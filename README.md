# Agri-Connect

## Introduction

In rural Rwanda, farming sustains the livelihood of numerous families. However, smallholder farmers encounter severe financial challenges caused by middlemen who purchase their products at low prices and sell them at exorbitant rates in urban markets. This exploitation not only diminishes farmers' profits but also contributes to widespread poverty. Additionally, it drives up prices in urban markets, exacerbating the cost of essential goods.
